# virus-scanner
The virus scanner project is a Python-based program that scans files for viruses. It uses a variety of methods to detect viruses, including checking for known virus signatures, scanning for suspicious code patterns, and analyzing file behavior. The project is still under development, but it has already been shown to be effective at detecting a variety of viruses.

The project is open source, which means that anyone can view the code and contribute to its development. This makes it a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn more about virus scanning or who wants to develop their own virus scanner.

The project is also well-documented, which makes it easy to use and understand. The documentation includes a tutorial that walks users through the process of installing and using the program, as well as a reference manual that describes the program's features in detail.
